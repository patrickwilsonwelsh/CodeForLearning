Where to get this codebase:

------------------------

Big Chunky Refactoring goals:


Extract one Page Object

Remove references to selenium itself from tests

Extract the HTMl Element objects required by that Page Object

Extract another Page Object

Extract the common Page Object behaviors into a base class

Make the Page Objects self verifying

Create Link objects that "know" how to get to their Page Objects, contextually

Convert all Xpath to CSS selector syntax (check execution times against various browsers, esp IE variants)

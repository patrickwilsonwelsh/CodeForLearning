   * When editing text files, like source code, one often happens to add 
   * spurious spaces and tabs at the end of each line. 
   * Instead of pressing the "End" key at each 
   * line and removing those invisible characters manually, a simple algorithm to remove them 
   * automatically at the press of a button might be useful.

      Test-drive the simplest code you can (in the src folder) that, 
      given an input string, produces a right-trimmed output string.
      
      Here are some tests that you could write (remember Beck's Test List technique):
      
      "abc   " -> "abc"
      "def\t " -> "def"
      "  cde" -> "  cde" (does not remove beginning whitespace)
      "ab\n cd \n" -> "ab\n cd\n" (removes whitespace for each line)
      "ab\r\ncd\n" -> "ab\r\ncd\n" (handles both Windows and Unix line endings)
      
      Are these all the meaningful tests cases, if each type of character can be intermixed
      with others in any combination?
